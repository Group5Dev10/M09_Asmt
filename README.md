# Module 9 Group Assessment: K-Nearest Neighbors 

### **Introduction**
The k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a supervised, lazy learning classifier that works off the assumption that similar things exist in close proximity. It can be used for either classification or regression problems. 

### **Navigation**
This repository is divided into a research presentation and 3 Jupyter Notebooks, each containing code that models the kNN algorithm on a different dataset.
